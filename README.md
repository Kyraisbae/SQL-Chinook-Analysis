# SQL-Chinook-Analysis
SQL queries and results for product sales analysis using Chinook database (Level 2, Task 5)
Elevvo Internship SQL Task⚡
SQL queries + results I worked on during my Elevvo Pathways internship as a Data Analyst Intern. This repo shows how I explored the data, found insights, and answered key business questions.

The analysis demonstrates SQL skills such as:
✅ JOINs across multiple tables
✅ Aggregations (SUM, AVG, GROUP BY)
✅ CASE statements for grouping regions
✅ Window functions (RANK(), ROW_NUMBER())
✅ Date functions for monthly/yearly trends
